# Abstract
It is important that people strive towards self-improvement, freedom and the pursuit of their own happiness. Somewhat inconveniently, instinctive, passive, "human-driven" decision-making is not the most reliable strategy for self-actualization because of the tendency for short-term, idealistic or emotional reasoning. The purpose of this application is to apply techniques derived from portfolio optimization to the study of the nature of wellbeing. This views **activities** as analogous to ***assets***, **events** as ***shifts in the news cycle*** and the **virtue system** as the ***adherence to fixed rules and principles of profitability***. The aim of this project is to determine what combinations of activities maximise an index of wellbeing (consisting of happiness,energy,productivity,stability). This project also heavily relies on the use of statistics and machine learning for the rigorous and systematic evaluation of personal data to uncover implicit causal structures of self-actualization

Auxiliary purposes include for organization and planning, positive habit reinforcement, maintaining a catalogue of events and the production of insight from personal data.
