# Abstract

>“Obedience to a “perfect master”.... At last, to be set free, to lay down one’s burden – to be a child again – not in renewed innocence, but in restored dependence, in admitted, undisguised dependence. To be told again, what to do, and how to do it” - Waking Up, Sam Harris 

Who am I? What do I want from life? And given the uncertainity that is inherent to life, how do I make decisions on how to live? And those different decisions, what are all the outcomes? How does the life I want even look like? And is there a way to develop a systematic strategies on how to get there? To develop a machine that definitively determines what your best life looks like from your current constraints, and actively works to identify paths to get there? What does the life I want even look like? An adaptive, learning machine that develops strategies to reach a variety of different positive outcomes and to make recommendations, to work towards predicting and avoiding negative outcomes?

The purpose of this application is to view life as an optimization problem and apply techniques from data science to the study of wellbeing. I aim to explore systematic strategies to allocate unstructured free time in a way that maximising individual human happiness over the lifespan (by tracking and optimising for a wellbeing index). The ultimate goal is help the user make progress towards "perfect resource allocation"; a hypothetical psuedo-mystical state where a person is doing precisely what they need to all the time. The concept of time is viewed finite resource that is continuously being exchanged for activities that provides some form of value. This project views life as a series of these (time-> activity-> value) transactions. I place a strong a emphasis on concept on continual exploration and consistent self refinement of values.

This project itself exists in the form of a useful organisational and planning tool that contains a useful suite of time-management tools such as to-do lists, schedules and journals. I also placed special attention to the look and feel of the application. After all, what good is an application if no-one enjoys using it? And these applets are
are interconnected with analytics to produce useful statistics about the user. 

At some point (though not an immediate priority) I would like to include upport of multiple users (which would allow for collective data gathering to support individual self-improvement) and the usage of AI for the optimization of daily schedules.  I think that this data analytical tool for self-improvement aims to deliver real value to people with the same very peculiar desires that I have i.e. to see my personal statistics laid out in front of me.

And if you'd like to work with me:
