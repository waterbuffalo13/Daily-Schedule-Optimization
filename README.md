Purpose:


It is important that people strive towards self-improvement, freedom and the pursuit of their own happiness. Somewhat inconveniently, instinctive, passive, "human-driven" decision-making is not the most reliable strategy for self-actualization because of the tendency for short-term, idealistic or emotional reasoning. The purpose of this application is to allow people to create tools for organization and planning, reinforce good habits, maintain a catalogue of events and the production of insight from personal data.

How?

In this application, life is viewed as an optimization problem which allows the user makes incremental progress towards approaching an optimal daily schedule (i.e. where your daily schedule is so meticulously constructed for wellbeing/energy/productivity as for every day to be considered the possible use of a day!). This is achieved through data collection through data entry through a user interface. This app aims to record personal information including daily planners (sleeping, eating, working, watching tv etc), journal entries, diet planners as well as an abundance of organizational benefits such as to-do lists, gantt-charts, journal entries. This data is in turn used for organization, reinforcement, cataloguing and insight production. Insight production such as automated feedback and suggested activities allows new activities to be tested and provides the user a tool to be able to discover, choose and partake in the activities and hobbies that provide the most meaning and satisfaction.

What?

Waterbuffalo Micromanagement is a highly interactive pandas/SQL-driven dashboard that is designed to work primarily as a productivity application that analyzes personal data with the aim of producing actionable feedback and insight. A unique feature of this dashboard is the ability to add information (e.g. journal entries) in real time through a user interface which allows for dynamic and responsive graphing of daily schedules, as well as active monitoring of wellbeing and energy over a specified timeframe. Other data visualized includes wellbeing/energy distributions, habit adherence and virtue hangling. The end goal is to be able to understand implicit causal structures of actualization, as well as the implementation of psychological strategies to ensure my adherence to these factors.

- **Organization**: I have attempted to categorize all of life's unique experiences into 7 distinct categories: Sleep, Work, Study, Exercise, Routine, Recreation and Indulgence.

- **Sleep**: Approximately one third of a human life is in this unconcious state. It is indivisible.

- **Work**: This encompasses all activities with a high potential either life maintenance or revenue generation. Can roughly be subdivided into three meaningful categories: domestic, paid and job hunting. 

- **Study**: These are self-improvement activities designed to expand my knowledge and skillset. Examples would be programming, lectures and reading.

- **Exercise**: Exercise is a long-term investment designed to add value to the daily activities of existing, including improved energy, vigour and wellbeing. Cardio, Resistance, Yoga, Sports etc.

- **Routine**: Mandatory breaks for breakfast lunch and dinner

- **Recreation**: Travel, unique, high value or novel experiences 

- **Indulgence**: Games, Movies, Music etc

This project can be summarized as an attempt to solve a very important question: 
- Time Allocation: 
  -	How should I structure my days to maximise wellbeing?
    - Should I be working on this project? 
    - Should I be applying for new jobs? 
    - Should I spend all of my time at home playing video games? 
- Event/Activity Analysis:
  -	What percentage of my day is leisure, work and commitment?
  - How does the distribution of wellbeing/energy look like?
  - What is the average amount of time slept/calories consumed/hours worked a day?
  
- Data Science
  - How do specific activities/events/people contribute to my overall wellbeing?
  - Whats the optimal amount of time I should allocate to specific activities? 
  - What activities/events are associated with productive days
  - How does the past affect the future (e.g. how do past activities/events affect future wellbeing)
  - How does reading/calorie counting/meditation/workout affect my wellbeing?


Schedule Structure:
-	How should I structure my days to maximise wellbeing?



To answer this question requires some methodology to quantify wellbeing. The quantification strategy in this instance requires inferring wellbeing from the journal entries using a sentiment analysis
