# Abstract
It is important that people strive towards self-improvement, freedom and the pursuit of their own happiness. Somewhat inconveniently, instinctive, passive, "human-driven" decision-making is not the most reliable strategy for self-actualization because of the tendency for short-term, idealistic or emotional reasoning. The purpose of this application is to view life as an optimization problem and apply techniques inspired from portfolio optimization to the study of wellbeing. 

From this perspective, **activities** are viewed as analogous to ***assets (a)*** of which returns are expected, **events** as ***shifts in the news cycle*** and the **virtue system** as the ***adherence to fixed rules and principles of profitability (Î¼i)*** with the aim of maximising an **index of wellbeing (R)**. This wellbeing index takes into account individual wellbeing (TTW), as well as accounting for management of explore/exploit tradeoffs

This project  heavily relies on the use of statistics and machine learning for the rigorous and systematic evaluation of personal data to uncover implicit causal structures of actualization

Auxiliary purposes include for organization and planning, positive habit reinforcement, maintaining a catalogue of events and the production of insight from personal data.
