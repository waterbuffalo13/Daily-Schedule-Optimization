# The Vision

>Who am I and what do I want? And given all the uncertainity that is inherent in life, how should I spend my free time? Under what metric? And those different decisions, how can I forsee and calculate all the outcomes? How does the life I want even look like? And how do I navigate my decisions to get there? Is it possible to develop a machine that quantifies and actively maps routes towards happiness, as well as identifying paths to get there? To live fully oriented towards the pursuit of happiness, freedom and self-improvement? To cultivate a purely logical lifestyle where potential is realized and to be free from the tragedy of opportunity cost? 

My attempt to answer all these questions is to develop an adaptive and usable application that develops bespoke strategies for various personalities and life situations, and to make recommendations on how to live that avoids short-term, idealistic and emotional reasoning. This can be achieved by making data-driven calculations on schedules and events to assess their quantitative impact on "wellbeing". In this way the app can make recommendations and to work towards predicting and avoiding negative outcomes.

The purpose of this application is to view life as an optimization problem and to apply techniques from data science to the study of wellbeing. I aim to explore systematic strategies to allocate uncommitted time in a way that maximises individual human happiness over the lifespan by tracking and optimising for a wellbeing index. The ultimate goal is help the user make progress towards a state of "perfect resource allocation"; a hypothetical psuedo-mystical state where a person is doing precisely what they need to all the time. The concept of time is viewed as finite resource that is continuously being exchanged for activities that provides some form of value. This project views life as a series of these (time-> activity-> value) transactions. By viewing life from this perspective, concepts such as return-on-investment and opportunity cost become quantifiable and measurable.

I place a strong a emphasis on concept on continual exploration and consistent self refinement of values.

This project itself exists in the form of a useful organisational and planning tool that contains a useful suite of applets such as to-do lists, schedules, habit trackers, diet planners and journals. I also placed special attention to the look and feel of the application. After all, what good is an application if no-one enjoys using it? And these applets are interconnected with analytics to produce useful statistics about the end-user. 

I believe that there is great potential for the usage of collective data gathering to support individual decision-making, and the development of AI for the optimization of daily schedules.  I want this data analytical tool for self-improvement aims to deliver real value to people with the same very peculiar desires that I have i.e. to see my personal statistics laid out in front of me and to make better decisions.

## How do you even quantify wellbeing?

The same way inflation, human development and other phenomena is measured. Through an Index! A weighted composite of non-related fundamental factors. With this problem it is a little tricky as you can't use the same coefficients as priorities vary from person to person. Coming up with a concise formula that describes the relationship between activities and events and mood is a tricky business. Whilst I wait for future patrick to make sense of it, I just get the user to use a number between -3 (sucidal) and 3 (euphoric) that I input along with the activities, that populates the mood graphs.

## What strategies do you use?

I haven't implemented any yet! Since this entire project was inspired by trading algorithms (now does this all make sense?!) it's likely many of the same approaches used in traditional finance portfolio optimization can be applied to this context.
