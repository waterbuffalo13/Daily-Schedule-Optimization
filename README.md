# The Vision

>Who am I and what do I want? And given all the uncertainity that is inherent in life how should I act? With what goal? And how can I navigate all the decisions yet to come? How does the life I want even look like? And how do I get there? Is it possible to systematise a life strategy? To realize potential and minimize opportunity cost? 

My attempt to answer all these questions is to develop an adaptive and usable application that develops bespoke strategies for various personalities and life situations, and to make recommendations on how to live that avoids short-term, idealistic and emotional reasoning. This can be achieved by making data-driven calculations on schedules and events to assess their quantitative impact on "wellbeing". In this way the app can make recommendations on what to do and how to act, and work towards predicting and avoiding negative outcomes. 

The purpose of this application is to view life as an optimization problem and to apply techniques from data science to the study of wellbeing. I aim to explore systematic strategies to allocate uncommitted time in a way that maximises individual human happiness over the lifespan by tracking and optimising for a wellbeing index. The ultimate goal is help the user make progress towards a state of "perfect resource allocation"; a hypothetical psuedo-mystical pattern of behaviour where a person is doing precisely what they need to all the time. The concept of time is viewed as finite resource that is continuously being exchanged for activities that provides some form of value. This project views life as a series of these (time-> activity-> value) transactions. By viewing life from this perspective, concepts such as return-on-investment and opportunity cost become quantifiable and measurable.

I place a strong a emphasis on concept on continual exploration and consistent self refinement of values.

This project itself exists in the form of a useful organisational and planning tool that contains a useful suite of applets such as to-do lists, schedules, habit trackers, diet planners and journals. I also placed special attention to the look and feel of the application. After all, what good is an application if no-one enjoys using it? And these applets are interconnected with analytics to produce useful statistics about the end-user. 

I believe that there is great potential for the usage of collective data gathering to support individual decision-making (in a future build this will allow multiple users), and the development of AI for the optimization of daily schedules.  I want this data analytical tool for self-improvement to deliver real value to people with the same very peculiar desires that I have i.e. to see my personal statistics laid out in front of me and to make better decisions.

## Why build this app?

After having more then a few bad days in a row, I became obsessed with the big questions (see quote on top). I spent a lot of time thinking about how it would be like under different circumstances. What if I had made different decisions on what hobbies I had, things I had done, subjects that I studied, risks I had taken? At one point I tried to draw a tree-like graph of all the different possibilities but I couldn't produce anything meaningful. And even if I did, it wouldn't really matter because I can't go back in time and evaluate all my alternatives. I think I wanted to build a fully rational, impartial advisor that would guide me through major life decisions and situations in a way that I could be sure of it's efficacy. An app that would make life exciting/meaningful and free me from much of the anxiety that I experience. But above all of that, I just wanted to build something cool.

## How do you even quantify wellbeing?

The same way inflation, socio-economic development and various other phenomena is measured i.e. through an index. A collection of non-related factors. With this index it is a little tricky as you can't use the same coefficients as priorities vary from person to person. Coming up with a concise formula that describes the relationship between activities and events and mood is a tricky business. Whilst I wait for future patrick to make sense of it, I just get the user to use a number between -3 (sucidal) and 3 (euphoric) based on how they feel that I input along with the activities that populates the mood graphs. 

## What strategies do you use?

I haven't implemented any yet! Since this entire project was inspired by trading algorithms (now does this all make sense?!) it's likely many of the same approaches used in traditional finance portfolio optimization can be applied to this context. I'm more of an AI enthusiast than an expert but I hope my knowledge grows with time. My priority right now is to develop the infrastructure so that it can support all the analysis I have planned.

## How does the virtue system work?

The virtue system is a series of meta-data collected that reflect a given ideal. Productivity is what proportion of time you spend on high-quality activities i.e. the ones with high returns. Integrity is what proportion of goals/commitments you actually follow through on. Self-restraint is how well you adhere to a system of positive habits. Wisdom represents time allocated to self-mastery. And rationality is simply the weighted average of all the previous. Fundamentally the idea is to give people a reason to use the application without trying to "win" it. These values reset every week, and so you always have a fresh start to go above and beyond.

## The End Goal: A Collective Conciousness?

My goal is to support the end users and to produce lasting value. To enrich peoples lives with new hobbies, lifestyles and ways of overcoming problems that they had not  previously considered. To answer definitively if your goal should be to work compulsively with the promise of a luxurious lifestyle, or to laze around on a field in some developing country,  or to tour the world in a van like some dried-up hippy. To understand how other users have gotten there and to provide the tools to get there. To reinforce good habits and promote good behaviour. To promote efficient resource-usage (e.g. time, money etc) and to spend it in ways you had not previously considered. To work to solve deeply embedded problems like mental health, debt and bad behaviour through multiple behavioural streams. To act as a companion in times of great difficulty and to provide fresh, new perspectives and call to actions. To increase collective commitment to rational self-interest.
