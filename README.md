Waterbuffalo Micromanagement is a highly interactive pandas/SQL-driven dashboard that is designed to work primarily as a productivity application, but also analyses and visualizes personal data with the aim of producing actionable insight. Data visualized included wellbeing and energy distributions (over a given timeframe), dynamic “gantt-charts” to graph my daily schedules and habit monitors. The end goal is to be able to understand implicit causal structures of self-actualization and create psychological strategies to ensure my adherence to these factors.

Whilst it's purpose and design philosophy has changed over time ultimately the project can be summarized as an attempt to solve a very important and fundamental question: What precisely should I be doing with my time? Should I be working on this project? Should I be applying for new jobs? Should I spend all of my time at home playing video games? An example could be going to the gym. Is going more often and for longer frequencies always increase my short-term wellbeing or is their a certain optimium? The question of time allocation needs to be solved in four parts, namely organization, reinforcement, cataloguing and insight production.

Organization:
I have attempted to categorize all of life's unique experiences into 7 distinct categories: Sleep, Work, Study, Exercise, Routine, Recreation and Indulgence.

Sleep: Approximately one third of a human life is in this unconcious state. It is indivisible.
Work: This encompasses all activities with a high potential either life maintenance or revenue generation. Can roughly be subdivided into three meaningful categories: domestic, paid and job hunting. 
Study: These are self-improvement activities designed to expand my knowledge and skillset. Examples would be programming, lectures and reading.
Exercise: Exercise is a long-term investment designed to add value to the daily activities of existing, including improved energy, vigour and wellbeing. Cardio, Resistance, Yoga, Sports etc.
Routine: Mandatory breaks for breakfast lunch and dinner
Recreation: Travel, unique, high value or novel experiences 
Indulgence: Games, Movies, Music etc
 


To answer this question requires some methodology to quantify wellbeing. The quantification strategy in this instance requires inferring wellbeing from the journal entries using a sentiment analysis
