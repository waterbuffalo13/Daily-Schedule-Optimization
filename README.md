# Abstract

>Who am I and what do I want? And given all the uncertainity that is inherent in my situation and life, how do I make decisions? Under what metric? And those different decisions, how can I forsee and calculate all the outcomes? How does the life I want even look like? And how do I navigate my decisions to get there? Is it possible to develop a machine that quantifies and actively maps routes towards happiness, as well as identifying paths to get there? To live fully oriented towards the pursuit of happiness, freedom and self-improvement? To cultivate a purely logical lifestyle where potential is realized and to be free from the tragedy of opportunity cost? 

My attempt to answer all these questions is to develop an adaptive, usable application that develops strategies for all situations and make recommendations on how to live that avoids short-term, idealistic and emotional reasoning and uses data-driven calculate the best lifestyle choices to produce a variety of different outcomes and to work towards make recommendations, to work towards predicting and avoiding negative outcomes.

The purpose of this application is to view life as an optimization problem and to apply techniques from data science into the study of wellbeing. I aim to explore systematic strategies to allocate uncommitted time in a way that maximises individual human happiness over the lifespan by tracking and optimising for a wellbeing index. The ultimate goal is help the user make progress towards a state of "perfect resource allocation"; a hypothetical psuedo-mystical state where a person is doing precisely what they need to all the time. The concept of time is viewed as finite resource that is continuously being exchanged for activities that provides some form of value. This project views life as a series of these (time-> activity-> value) transactions. I place a strong a emphasis on concept on continual exploration and consistent self refinement of values.

This project itself exists in the form of a useful organisational and planning tool that contains a useful suite of applets such as to-do lists, schedules, habit trackers, diet planners and journals. I also placed special attention to the look and feel of the application. After all, what good is an application if no-one enjoys using it? And these applets are interconnected with analytics to produce useful statistics about the end-user. 

I think that there is great potential for the usage of collective data gathering to support individual decision-making, and the development of AI for the optimization of daily schedules.  I think that this data analytical tool for self-improvement aims to deliver real value to people with the same very peculiar desires that I have i.e. to see my personal statistics laid out in front of me and to make better decisions.
