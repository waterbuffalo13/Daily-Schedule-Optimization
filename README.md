The purpose of this application is to view life as an optimization problem, where the user is encouraged to discover, choose and partake in the activities and hobbies that provide the most meaning and satisfaction. Positive behaviour is encouraged through a mixture of strategies derived from psychology including variable-ratio schedules and behavioural therapy. 

1. Organization:
   - to-do list & scheduler
      - Create a task (done)
     - Delete a task (done)
     - Add an element to the schedule
     - Delete elements from a schedule
   - Measurement & Tracking
     - Log bucket list
     - Reading
2.  Reinforce:
        - Proactively identify potential obstacles for completing tasks and preemptively come up with solutions
        - Specify and recognize the importance of each task and how it contributes towards a greater goal
      And if you do not complete the task by the deadline: 
        - Textbox on failure of tasks (e.g. what would happen if you continued failing this task)
3. Catalogue:
