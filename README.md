# Abstract

>“Obedience to a “perfect master”.... At last, to be set free, to lay down one’s burden – to be a child again – not in renewed innocence, but in restored dependence, in admitted, undisguised dependence. To be told again, what to do, and how to do it” - Waking Up, Sam Harris 

This project is my attempt to produce a useful organisation tool (though atm it has only been partially developed). The project contains a useful suite of time-management tools such as to-do lists, schedules and journals that are interconnected with analytics that produce useful information such as statistics on personal information, whilst suggesting new activities and improvements to schedule. Potential areas for growth include the application for support of multiple users (which would allow for collective data to support individual self-improvement) and the usage of AI for the optimization of daily schedules.  I think that this data analytical tool for self-improvement aims to deliver real value to people with the same very peculiar desires that I have i.e. to organize, catalogue and improve.

For one, Micromanagement provides a collection of powerful, intuitive and useful time-management features that can be accessed from a single page. At a glance, a user can plan their day, create daily tasks, write and draw notes from books/meetings, track their habits, write into their journal and refine their long-term goals and vision for the future. Further still, because of Micromanage's integration with powerful analytical tools it  can provide powerful, bespoke and unique insight that would otherwise be unavailable through even the deepest introspection, delivered with a quantifiable accuracy and precision.

The underlying theory of Micromanage is that by the continual micromanagement of small things (sleep, diet, types of activities undertaken) you can make walloping improvements to how you feel in the present, and how you end up in the future. More concretely, the central idea is that your daily activities accounts for a large proportion of your mood and that by observing your schedule and applying a consistent, non-coercive, exploratory force to what activities you pursue you can optimise the construction of your schedule for happiness. By creating an application that allows the user to manage their life from a single place, this also creates the means to explore this hypothesis.

This project  heavily relies on the use of statistics and machine learning for the rigorous and systematic evaluation of personal data to uncover implicit causal structures of actualization. Auxiliary purposes include for organization and planning, positive habit reinforcement, maintaining a catalogue of events and the production of insight from personal data.

From this perspective, **activities** are viewed as analogous to ***assets (a)*** of which returns are expected, **events** as ***shifts in the news cycle*** and the **virtue system** as the ***adherence to fixed rules and principles of profitability (μi)*** with the aim of maximising an **index of wellbeing (R)**. This wellbeing index takes into account individual wellbeing (TTW), as well as accounting for management of explore/exploit tradeoffs.

It is important that people strive towards self-improvement, freedom and the pursuit of their own happiness. Somewhat inconveniently, instinctive, passive, "human-driven" decision-making is not the most reliable strategy for self-actualization because of the tendency for short-term, idealistic or emotional reasoning. The purpose of this application is to view life as an optimization problem and apply techniques inspired from portfolio optimization to the study of wellbeing. 

Time is a finite resource that is continuously being exchanged for activities that provides some form of value. Therefore, it is important to select activities that are the most beneficial for human happiness and thriving. This project views life as a series of these (time-> activity-> value) transactions.
