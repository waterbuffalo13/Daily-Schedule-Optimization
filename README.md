It is important that people strive towards self-improvement, freedom and the pursuit of their own happiness. Somewhat inconveniently, instinctive, passive, "human-driven" decision-making is not the most reliable strategy for self-actualization because of the tendency for short-term, idealistic or emotional reasoning. The purpose of this application is to apply techniques inspired from portfolio optimization to the study of wellbeing. This views activities as analogous to assets which are expected to produce returns, events as shifts in news and the virtue system as the adherence to fixed rules and principles with the ultimate aim of maximising a wellbeing index. This project also heavily relies on the use of statistics and machine learning as tools for self-improvement through the rigorous and systematic evaluation of personal data to uncover implicit causal structures that negatively affect wellbeing. Auxiliary purposes include for organization and planning, positive habit reinforcement, maintaining a catalogue of events and the production of insight from personal data.
